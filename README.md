Graphs for Scala. Cross-compiled with Dotty and Scala 2.

Work in progress.

### Usage

 * Compile code with `sbt compile` 
 * Run it with `sbt run`
 * `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL. 

Now you can see usage in [tests](src/test/scala/com/manenkov/lib/Test1.scala). This document will be updated later.
